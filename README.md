Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This web app is a very simple site about... corgis! Index.html contains the main page, funfact.html contains the page with an ordered list of fun facts,
info.html contains the page with a table about basic corgi information, and gallery.html uses the bootstrap grid layout to display a gallery of images.
Additionally, on each page is a navigation bar that allows the user to get to one page to another. In the styling pages, there are two separate css files:
one for image styling and another for basic styling. This was mainly for organizational purposes.
